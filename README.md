E3-Core
A Blockchain-Powered Gold Standard for the Digital Age
Where money is backed by gold — and governed by the people.

📜 About This Project
This project? It kinda started because I was bored.

I’m a student, new to coding, just curious and figuring things out. But as I got deeper into learning how to build things, I started noticing a pattern:

Why does everything keep getting more expensive while life feels cheaper?

I didn’t like how I don’t really have a say in the money I use, what it’s worth, or what I’m really paying for when I save or spend. Meanwhile, the cost of living keeps going up, but the standard of living? Not so much.

As I explored more, I stumbled on blockchain and crypto. But let’s be real:

Most people don’t trust or even understand blockchain.
And honestly, who can blame them? Crypto is cool tech but often feels abstract, unstable, or scammy.

That’s when I thought: Why not mix something people do understand — like the gold standard — with blockchain’s transparency and programmability? That’s where Ellipe 3 and this repo, E3-Core, come in.

This is my personal experiment to reimagine money with:

The trust of gold backing

The openness of blockchain 

And governance by the people who actually use it

🌟 What is E3-Core?
E3-Core is the protocol foundation of Ellipe 3:
A gold-backed, blockchain-based monetary system designed to give everyday people a currency with real value, clear rules, and democratic governance.

Core Features
🔒 Gold-Backed Dual Token Model

Gold Units (GU): Represent audited, real-world gold reserves.

Standard Units (SU): Everyday currency, pegged to gold via protocol rules.

📜 On-Chain Proof of Reserve

Admin nodes can’t mint new GU without verified gold deposits.

🗳️ Democratic Governance

1 person = 1 vote. Proposals, policies, and updates decided by the community — not some central bank.

⚖️ Elastic Supply (But With Limits!)

SU expands/contracts based on economic demand, keeping value stable but avoiding the "print money endlessly" problem.
